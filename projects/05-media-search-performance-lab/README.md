## 🚀 Live Demo

🔗 Live demo pending deployment.

## 🧠 Overview

This project is the **fifth practical build** in the `react-learning` repository.

It applies performance-focused React patterns in a search-driven interface with two data modes: anime and movies. The app combines reusable UI, custom hooks, API adapters, loading states, responsive result cards, and a lazy-loaded details modal.

## 💡 Why This Project

This build practices performance-minded React development in a realistic search flow.

It is designed to balance render optimization, perceived performance, and polished UI states without overusing memoization or adding unnecessary abstractions.

## 🎯 Key Learnings

- Search-driven UI with `anime` and `movies` modes
- Memoized derived data with `useMemo`
- Stable interaction handlers with `useCallback`
- Code splitting with `lazy` and `Suspense`

- Perceived performance with loading, shimmer, and lazy image strategies
- Accessible modal behavior with focus management and keyboard support
- Responsive modal and result-grid polish across breakpoints

## ⚙️ Getting Started

```bash
cd react-learning/projects/05-media-search-performance-lab
npm install
npm run dev
```

Create a `.env.local` file if you want movie search support through TMDB:

```bash
VITE_TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key
```

Anime search works through the public Jikan API.
